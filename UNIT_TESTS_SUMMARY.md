- Form validation and user feedback

## Test Architecture

### Mocking Strategy
- **Data Functions**: Mocked all data fetching functions to return predictable test data
- **External Dependencies**: Mocked toast notifications, localStorage, clipboard API
- **Navigation Context**: Mocked navigation functions for testing user interactions
- **Hooks**: Mocked custom hooks like `useAsyncDataAll` for controlled testing

### Test Utilities
- Used existing test utilities from `src/test/test-utils.tsx`
- Leveraged React Testing Library for component testing
- Used Vitest for test framework and mocking
- Implemented proper cleanup with `beforeEach` and `afterEach`

### Test Patterns
- **Component Rendering**: Test that components render with correct content
- **User Interactions**: Test button clicks, form submissions, navigation
- **Data States**: Test loading, error, and success states
- **Form Validation**: Test input validation and error messages
- **Empty States**: Test behavior when no data is available
- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery

## Key Testing Features

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
Each test file covers:
- Basic rendering and functionality
- User interactions and navigation
- Data loading and error states
- Form validation and submission
- CRUD operations
- Search and filtering
- Empty and error states

### 2. Realistic Test Data
- Created mock data that matches the expected data structures
- Used realistic values for testing (dates, IDs, names)
- Included edge cases and various states

### 3. User-Centric Testing
- Tests focus on user interactions and workflows
- Validates that UI elements work as expected
- Tests accessibility and usability features

### 4. Error Handling
- Tests error states and recovery mechanisms
- Validates error messages and user feedback
- Tests retry functionality and fallback states

## Running the Tests

To run the new unit tests:

```bash
# Run all new tests
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/ComplianceTracking.test.tsx src/components/__tests__/Geofences.test.tsx src/components/__tests__/Alerts.test.tsx src/components/__tests__/NotificationPreferencesNew.test.tsx src/components/__tests__/HierarchicalAlertConfiguration.test.tsx src/components/__tests__/Settings.test.tsx

# Run individual test files
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/ComplianceTracking.test.tsx
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/Geofences.test.tsx
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/Alerts.test.tsx
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/NotificationPreferencesNew.test.tsx
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/HierarchicalAlertConfiguration.test.tsx
npm test -- --run src/components/__tests__/Settings.test.tsx
```

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures components work as expected
2. **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch breaking changes during development
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of component behavior
4. **Confidence**: Developers can make changes with confidence that tests will catch issues
5. **User Experience**: Tests validate that user interactions work correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration Tests**: Add tests that verify component interactions
2. **Performance Tests**: Add tests for component performance with large datasets
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Add more comprehensive accessibility testing
4. **Visual Regression Tests**: Add tests for visual consistency
5. **E2E Tests**: Add end-to-end tests for complete user workflows

The unit tests provide a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and ensuring the reliability of the application's core functionality.

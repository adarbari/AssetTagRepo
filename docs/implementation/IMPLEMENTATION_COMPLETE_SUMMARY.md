## Files Created/Updated in This Session

### New Files Created
1. `/components/HierarchicalAlertConfiguration.tsx` - Full hierarchical alert config UI
2. `/data/mockVehicleData.ts` - Vehicle data and pairings
3. `/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan
4. `/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Files Updated
1. `/App.tsx` - Integrated HierarchicalAlertConfiguration
2. `/types/index.ts` - Added Vehicle type, extended Geofence type

---

## Backend Integration Status

### ✅ Ready for API Integration

**Pattern for ALL data operations**:
```typescript
// Current (Mock)
export async function getVehicles(): Promise<Vehicle[]> {
  return mockVehicles;
}

// Future (Real API) - NO COMPONENT CHANGES NEEDED!
export async function getVehicles(): Promise<Vehicle[]> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/vehicles');
  return response.json();
}
```

**Components don't care about data source**:
- They call async functions
- Handle loading states
- Handle errors
- Display results

### API Endpoints Ready to Implement

- [ ] Select different entities (sites, assets, jobs)
- [ ] Click on alert type cards
- [ ] Configure alert settings
- [ ] Save configuration → verify success toast
- [ ] Create override at lower level
- [ ] Delete override → verify fallback to parent
- [ ] Check inheritance indicators
- [ ] Verify "Inherited from X" messages

#### Job Management ✅
- [ ] Create new job
- [ ] Add assets to job
- [ ] Assign vehicle to job
- [ ] Mark assets as required
- [ ] Update budget
- [ ] Update actual costs
- [ ] View budget variance
- [ ] Check job alerts

- [ ] Search jobs

#### Vehicle-Based Geofencing ⏳
- [ ] Navigate to Create Geofence
- [ ] Select "Vehicle-Based" type
- [ ] Choose vehicle from dropdown
- [ ] Verify map centers on vehicle

### Data Flow Tests

#### State Management
- [ ] Alert configs save to localStorage
- [ ] Alert configs load on refresh
- [ ] Jobs save to localStorage

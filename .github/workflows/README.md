# CI/CD Workflows

This directory contains the optimized GitHub Actions workflows for the Asset Tag Repository.

## üöÄ Optimized Architecture

We've restructured the workflows to follow industry best practices with a **gate-based approach** that ensures code quality and security before running expensive tests.

### Workflow Overview

#### 1. **`lint-gate.yml`** - Lint and Security Gate (NEW)
- **Triggers**: All pushes/PRs to `main`/`develop`
- **Purpose**: Entry point that MUST pass before main CI runs
- **Smart Execution**: Path-based triggers - only checks changed components
- **Auto-fix Integration**: Automatically fixes ~80% of lint issues
- **Security First**: Runs security checks early (shift-left security)
- **Blocking**: Main CI only runs if this gate passes

**Jobs:**
- `changes` - Detects which components changed
- `lint-and-security-check` - Comprehensive lint + security validation
- `auto-fix` - Auto-fixes issues (in-memory, no commit)
- `re-validate` - Re-runs checks after auto-fix
- `commit-fixes` - Commits fixes if validation passes
- `create-issue` - Creates issues for unfixable problems
- `final-status` - Determines gate pass/fail status

#### 2. **`main-ci.yml`** - Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline
- **Triggers**: Only after `lint-gate.yml` succeeds
- **Purpose**: Full validation, testing, and coverage reporting
- **Smart Execution**: Path-based triggers - only runs tests for changed components
- **Parallel Processing**: Backend and frontend jobs run simultaneously
- **Integrated Coverage**: Coverage reporting built-in
- **Security Validation**: Comprehensive security checks (bandit, safety, npm audit)

**Jobs:**
- `gate-check` - Verifies lint-gate passed
- `changes` - Detects which components changed
- `backend-lint` - Additional backend linting (redundant with gate)
- `backend-test` - Matrix strategy for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- `backend-security` - Comprehensive security validation
- `backend-coverage` - Coverage reporting
- `frontend-test` - Frontend testing
- `frontend-build` - Build validation
- `frontend-coverage` - Coverage reporting
- `combined-coverage` - Aggregates all coverage data

#### 3. **`quick-test.yml`** - Fast Development Feedback
- **Triggers**: All pushes/PRs (excludes docs changes)
- **Purpose**: Fast feedback for developers (runs in parallel with lint-gate)
- **Smart Execution**: Path-based triggers - only tests changed components
- **Fast Tests**: Unit tests only (no matrix, no comprehensive tests)
- **Quick Feedback**: 2-3 minute execution time

**Jobs:**
- `changes` - Detects which components changed
- `quick-backend-test` - Python 3.11 only, unit tests
- `quick-frontend-test` - Basic tests only

#### 4. **Archived Workflows** (in `archive/` directory)
- `pre-lint-check.yml` - Replaced by `lint-gate.yml`
- `auto-fix-reusable.yml` - Functionality integrated into `lint-gate.yml`

## üéØ Workflow Execution Flow

### Automatic Flow (Recommended)
1. **Push/PR** ‚Üí Triggers both `lint-gate.yml` and `quick-test.yml` in parallel
2. **Lint Gate** ‚Üí Runs lint + security checks, auto-fixes issues if needed
3. **Quick Test** ‚Üí Provides fast feedback (2-3 minutes) while gate runs
4. **Main CI** ‚Üí Only runs if lint-gate passes (5-8 minutes)
5. **Result** ‚Üí Clear pass/fail status with detailed reporting

### Manual Workflow Selection

#### For Production/Release
- **Automatic**: Lint-gate ‚Üí Main CI (if gate passes)
- **Execution Time**: 3-5 minutes (gate) + 5-8 minutes (main CI if needed)
- **Coverage**: Full validation, security scanning, comprehensive testing

#### For Development
- **Automatic**: Lint-gate + Quick Test (parallel)
- **Execution Time**: 2-3 minutes (quick test) + 3-5 minutes (gate)
- **Coverage**: Fast feedback + comprehensive lint/security validation

## üìä Key Improvements

### Immediate Benefits
- **Gate-based approach**: Lint issues caught before expensive tests
- **Auto-fix integration**: ~80% of lint issues fixed automatically
- **Shift-left security**: Security checks run early and comprehensively
- **No wasted compute**: Main CI only runs on validated code
- **Clear blocking**: Single gate shows pass/fail status clearly

### Smart Execution
- **Path-based triggers**: Only runs tests for changed components
- **Concurrency control**: Cancels outdated runs automatically
- **Parallel execution**: Lint-gate and quick-test run simultaneously
- **Conditional jobs**: Security scans in both gate and main CI
- **Workflow dependencies**: Main CI only runs if gate passes

### Developer Experience
- **Fast feedback**: Quick-test provides 2-3 minute feedback
- **Auto-remediation**: Most lint issues fixed automatically
- **Clear status**: Single gate workflow shows pass/fail clearly
- **Rich reporting**: Detailed error categorization and PR comments
- **Industry standard**: Follows GitHub Actions and DevSecOps best practices

## üîß Technical Details

### Environment Variables
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: '3.11'
- `NODE_VERSION`: '20.x'

### Dependencies

#### Backend
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 (matrix strategy)
- pip dependencies from `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
- Security tools: bandit, safety

#### Frontend
- Node.js 20.x
- npm dependencies from `package.json`
- Security audit: npm audit

### Artifacts
- `frontend-build`: Built frontend application
- `security-reports`: Backend security scan results
- `combined-coverage-report`: Aggregated coverage data

### Caching Strategy
- **pip dependencies**: Cached by Python version and requirements hash
- **npm dependencies**: Cached by package-lock.json hash
- **Restore keys**: Fallback to broader cache keys for faster restores

## üö® Lint-Gate Auto-Fix Integration

### How It Works
1. **Initial Check**: Runs comprehensive lint + security checks
2. **Auto-Fix**: If checks fail, automatically fixes issues (in-memory)
3. **Re-Validation**: Re-runs checks to verify fixes worked
4. **Commit**: If validation passes, commits fixes automatically
5. **Issue Creation**: If auto-fix fails, creates GitHub issues

### Supported Fixes
- ‚úÖ **Import Sorting**: Fixes with isort
- ‚úÖ **Code Formatting**: Fixes with black and prettier
- ‚úÖ **ESLint Issues**: Auto-fixes with eslint --fix
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Issues**: Basic type fixes
- ‚úÖ **Security Issues**: Creates issues for manual review

### Workflow Modes
- **In-Workflow Mode**: Fixes applied in-memory, no commits
- **Commit Mode**: Fixes committed automatically if validation passes
- **Issue Mode**: Creates issues for unfixable problems

### Permissions Required
- `contents: write` - Commit auto-fixes
- `issues: write` - Create GitHub issues
- `pull-requests: write` - Comment on PRs

## üìà Workflow Triggers

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

### Mock Setup Enhancements
- Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- Proper setup for React Testing Library
- Mock implementations for Radix UI components
- Icon mocking for Lucide React
- Chart library mocking for Recharts

### Test Utilities
- Enhanced test setup with proper mocks
- Global error handling in test environment
- Proper cleanup and restoration of mocks
- Accessibility testing utilities

## Expected Coverage Improvements

Based on the new tests created, the expected improvements are:

### Direct Coverage Gains
- **Reports Component**: ~300+ lines of code now covered
- **Error Handler Utilities**: ~100+ lines of code now covered  
- **API Service**: ~200+ lines of code now covered
- **Async Data Hooks**: ~130+ lines of code now covered

### Estimated New Coverage
- **Statements**: Expected to increase from 0.22% to ~2-3%
- **Branches**: Expected to increase from 22.47% to ~30-35%
- **Functions**: Expected to increase from 17.36% to ~25-30%
- **Lines**: Expected to increase from 0.22% to ~2-3%

## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. Component Testing
- State management testing
- User interaction testing
- Props and callback testing
- Error boundary testing
- Accessibility testing

### 2. Hook Testing
- State transitions
- Effect dependencies
- Error handling
- Async operations
- Custom logic

### 3. Service Testing
- API communication
- Error scenarios
- Authentication
- Data transformation
- Environment handling

### 4. Utility Testing
- Pure function testing
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Integration scenarios

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### 1. Component Coverage
- Add tests for remaining major components (Dashboard, AssetInventory, Geofences)
- Focus on user-facing components first
- Test form validation and submission flows

### 2. Integration Testing
- Add end-to-end user flow tests
- Test component interactions
- Test data flow between components

### 3. Service Layer
- Add tests for remaining services (assetService, alertService, etc.)
- Mock external API calls properly
- Test error recovery scenarios

### 4. Custom Hooks
- Test remaining custom hooks
- Add tests for hook composition
- Test hook performance and optimization

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run specific test files
npm run test src/components/__tests__/Reports.test.tsx
npm run test src/utils/__tests__/errorHandler.test.ts
npm run test src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts
npm run test src/hooks/__tests__/useAsyncData.test.ts
```

### Coverage Reports
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage in browser
open coverage/index.html
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Conclusion

The test coverage improvements provide a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. The new tests cover critical functionality including:

- Component rendering and user interactions
- Error handling and edge cases
- API communication and data fetching
- Custom hook behavior and state management
- Utility functions and service layers

These improvements significantly enhance the project's test coverage and provide better confidence in code changes and deployments.

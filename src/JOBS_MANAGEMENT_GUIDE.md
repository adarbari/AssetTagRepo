- Budget scenarios (under, on, and over budget)
- Asset loading scenarios (complete and missing assets)
- Team assignments and vehicle allocations

This data demonstrates the full capabilities of the system and provides realistic examples for testing and demonstration.

## API & Backend Integration

When implementing backend integration:

### Endpoints Needed
```
POST   /api/jobs              - Create new job
GET    /api/jobs              - List all jobs
GET    /api/jobs/:id          - Get job details
PUT    /api/jobs/:id          - Update job
DELETE /api/jobs/:id          - Delete job
POST   /api/jobs/:id/assets   - Add asset to job
DELETE /api/jobs/:id/assets/:assetId - Remove asset
PUT    /api/jobs/:id/costs    - Update actual costs
GET    /api/jobs/:id/alerts   - Get job alerts
POST   /api/jobs/:id/complete - Mark job as complete
```

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connection for live cost updates
- Push notifications for job alerts
- Real-time asset loading status
- Live budget variance calculations

## Navigation & UX

The Job Management feature is positioned in the **Operations** section of the navigation, emphasizing its role as a core operational tool alongside:
- Maintenance (equipment upkeep)
- Vehicle Pairing (fleet management)
- Find Asset (quick asset location)

This positioning makes it easily accessible for daily operational tasks while maintaining separation from monitoring (Geofences, Alerts) and analytics (Reports, Historical Playback) functions.

## Conclusion

The Job Management system is designed to be the central hub for project execution in asset-intensive businesses. It connects assets, vehicles, teams, and financials into a unified view that supports planning, execution, monitoring, and analysis throughout the entire project lifecycle.

Future enhancements will continue to add value through automation, intelligence, and integration, making it an increasingly powerful tool for business operations and decision-making.

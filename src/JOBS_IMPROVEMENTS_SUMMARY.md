# Jobs Management Improvements - Visual Summary

## What Changed

### 1. Navigation Name & Position ✨

**Before:**
```
Operations
├── Find Asset
├── Maintenance
├── Vehicle Pairing
└── Job Costing 💰 (DollarSign icon)
```

**After:**
```

├── Maintenance
├── Vehicle Pairing
└── Find Asset
```

**Why Better:**
- "Jobs" is clearer and more accurate than "Job Costing"
- Package icon represents work/projects better than dollar sign
- Positioned first in Operations (highest priority operational function)
- Simpler terminology, easier to understand

## Navigation Context

### New Category Organization

**Operations** (Daily work execution):
```
📦 Jobs              ← Primary operational function
🔧 Maintenance       ← Equipment upkeep
🚚 Vehicle Pairing   ← Fleet management
🎯 Find Asset        ← Quick asset location
```

**Monitoring** (Oversight & compliance):
```
📍 Geofences         ← Geographic boundaries
🔔 Alerts            ← All alert types
🛡️ Compliance        ← Regulatory tracking
```

**Analytics** (Insights & reporting):
```
📊 Reports           ← Comprehensive reporting
📈 Historical Playback ← Timeline visualization
```

This organization makes it clear that:
- Jobs is the core operational tool
- It's separate from monitoring (different user intent)
- It's separate from analytics (action vs observation)
